PHOSPHOR is an LED art installation at [Amino's](https://www.amino.com) headquarters in San Francisco. This
program controls 400 individually addressable LEDs through a variety of procedurally generated patterns,
each designed to accent the workspace by their curious nature.

The system consists of a Raspberry Pi 3, FadeCandy controller, and WS2811 LEDs.
