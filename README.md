PHOSPHOR is an LED art installation at [Amino's](https://www.amino.com) headquarters in San Francisco. This
program controls 400 individually addressable LEDs through a variety of procedurally generated patterns,
each designed to accent the workspace by their curious nature.

The system consists of a Raspberry Pi 3, FadeCandy controller, and WS2811 LEDs.

###Installation:

1. Download [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/?processing)
2. Install [Fadecandy server](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy)
3. Clone this repo into your Processing sketchbook folder

Special thanks to [Mark Slee](https://github.com/mcslee/) & [Heron Arts](https://github.com/heronarts/) for developing [LX Studio](https://lx.studio) and the [P3LX library]((https://github.com/heronarts/P3LX)), which powers PHOSPHOR.
